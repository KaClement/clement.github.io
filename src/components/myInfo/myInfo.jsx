        <h2 className='title_section'>About Me</h2>
        <br />
        <p>My journey into Python development began during my university years, where I've been actively pursuing both Python programming and data science. 
            One of my earliest projects, and still a favorite, was creating a Movie Recommendation System Application during my second year at the University of Geneva. 
            This project marked a significant milestone as my first foray into Python development and sparked a lasting interest in machine learning.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Since then, I've delved deeper into the realms of data science, taking courses in data mining, calculus, algebra, statistics, and probability. These studies have fueled my passion for utilizing data to uncover meaningful insights and develop practical solutions.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>While I'm dedicated to honing my skills in Python development and data science, 
            I also enjoy exploring other interests outside of technology. 
            In my spare time, you'll often find me playing poker or diving into the rich tapestry of cinema.</p>
